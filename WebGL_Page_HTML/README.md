# Fluid_Dynamics
Fluid Dynamics WebGL experiment based off (and heavily borrowed from) these experiments:

I have a talk through the maths here, hopefully it has some semblance of sense:

It's a pretty handy exercise in using the Navier-Stokes equations, and one that's
used in a lot of modern video games as well as some pretty useful simulations.

I'm going to keep coming back to the project to make changes over a long period
of time. As it's something that's been done so many times before I'm not as
bothered to keep working on it as a main project.
